# WebViewDebug Android Plugin for Cordova 3.X #
By Jamie Starke

## Why do you want this? ##
As of Android 4.4, Google has enabled some amazing new functionality, [Debugging Android WebViews](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging#debugging-webviews).

To be able to enable this functionality though, you have to add a piece of code to [Configure your WebViews for Debugging](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging#configure-webview)

Since this was something I would need while developing, but not during production, I figured that I would make this
as a plugin, so it could easily be removed before I release my code.

## Requirements ##

You will require the Android 4.4 (SDK 19) build tools and SDK.

The `platforms/android/project.properties` file will need to be updated so that `target=android-19` as this was functionality added
in Android 4.4.

You may also have to [change your Android Target from 17 to 19](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19734065/1017797). Follow that post, but
instead of using `18` use `19`.

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##
1. To install the plugin, use the Cordova CLI and enter the following:

    cordova plugin add https://github.com/jrstarke/webview-debug.git

## Removing the plugin before you release ##
1. To remove the plugin use the Cordova CLI and enter the following:

    cordova plugin remove com.jamiestarke.webviewdebug

## To Debug WebViews ##

Make sure that you have [adb installed](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging#install-adbplugin),
and that [USB debugging is enabled on your device](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging#enable-usb-debugging).

1. Connect your device to your computer using a USB cable.
2. In your Chrome 30+ browser, open the url **about:inspect**.
3. Find the application you would like to debug in the list, and click the `inspect` link.
